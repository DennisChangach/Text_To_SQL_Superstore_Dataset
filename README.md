# Chat with your Database: Simplifying Database Queries with Langchain.

### Introduction
In today's data-driven world, the ability to extract insights from databases is crucial for decision-making across various domains. However, querying databases often requires proficiency in SQL or a deep understanding of data analysis techniques, posing a significant barrier for non-technical users. 

In this article, we'll explore how to bridge this gap by leveraging on generative AI to enable users to query databases using simple, conversational language. By enabling natural language queries, users can interact with databases in a more intuitive and user-friendly manner, without the need to learn SQL syntax. This approach democratizes access to data, empowering non-technical users to derive insights and make informed decisions.

### Project Overview
In this project, we'll demonstrate how to enable natural language queries for a database using Language Models (LLMs) and NLP techniques. We'll utilize the LangChain library, which provides tools for integrating LLMs with databases, to streamline the process. The project consists of three main components:

- Creating a Database: For this project, weâ€™ll use the Tableau Superstore dataset.  It includes data for the Sales of multiple products sold by a company along with subsequent information related to the orders.
- Generating SQL Queries with LLMs: We'll leverage Google's Palm LLM to generate SQL queries based on user input questions. The LLM will interpret user queries and convert them into syntactically correct SQL queries, enabling seamless interaction with the database.
- Building a Streamlit UI: We'll develop a user-friendly interface using Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive web applications. The UI will allow users to input questions in natural language, execute SQL queries generated by the LLM, and visualize the results in real-time.
